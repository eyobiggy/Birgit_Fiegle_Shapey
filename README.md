Welcome to Shapey: my final coding project for Tech Basics I!

Shapey is a playful and interactive Python application that generates abstract digital art based on user-chosen visual "vibes". 
The final product is a fully functional, GUI-based background generator built with Pygame and Pillow, allowing users to create and save aesthetic artworks composed of randomized shapes and vibrant palettes.

The tool is meant to be fun, accessible, and surprising. Users can adjust complexity, select color moods, and generate new visuals with the press of a button.
